# This is an exercise project that I wrote during my internship in IELTSways Academy These codes are for implementing a shopping cart as well as products.

## The APIs I wrote for this project are as follows:
  - An API for user login
  - An API for products
  - An API for the shopping cart
## Each of which has different parts.

- The login api is available at this address  `login/`
- The register api is available at this address  `register/`
- The profile detail api is available at this address  `profile/<int:pk>/`
- The token refresh api is available at this address  `token/refresh/`
